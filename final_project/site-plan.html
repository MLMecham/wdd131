<!-- My plan is to have the front page have a gretting, purpose, goals,
 and a way for the user to select topics and number of questions. I will use
 query selectors to pass the information to the second page that will hold the
 questions. The information will be topics, number of questions, or difficulty. 
 The questions will be multiple choice, true or false, or free response.
 JS on the first page will be to get the parameters and create a query selector.
 The JS on the second page will be to dynamically generate the quiz and score it. 

 Each question will have the following properties: Question, Type, Options, Answer, Points.

 Navigation: Use window.location.href or localStorage to move between pages and persist data.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>My purpose for this website is to provide a fun learning oppertunity for anybody seeking a challenge.
            The questions will range from easy to nigh impossible so all ages will be able to find something to do.
            The website will ask the user what topics they want the questions to be about and how many then want to answer,
            then the second page will be brain buster quiz.
        </p>
        <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>My audience is for anybody who can read and likes challenges. There will be general trivial to riddles. Anybody can participate</p>
        <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
        <p>Page one will have multiple select elements with many options. The JavaScript will 
            receive the selected options from the user when they click the "Start Quiz" button.
            Once they click it, the JS will load a query selector to send their options to the second page of the site, the quiz.
            Page two will dynamially load the quiz html from the questions pool. It will take the options passed from page one, filter the questions to that criteria, and then load the questions.
            the submit quiz button will then be at the bottom of the second page. When clicked, it will score the users quiz and give them their results.

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.

        <p>Welcome to the Brain Buster's Quiz!</p>
        <p>This quiz is designed with fun in mind, but that doesn't mean these questions are easy. Each question has a difficulty score assigned to it,
             these scores start at 1 and end at 5. Difficulty 1 can be reliably answered by most elementary students, while difficulty 5 are tough to answer to those even
             with graduate degrees because of the obscure topics they cover. All questions are either True-False questions or multiple choice, so even if the question has busted you brain, just give it your best guess.
        </p>
        <p>Below you may select the number of questions you want to answer, the difficutly of questions you want to answer, and the type of question. Please select to your liking and click on the start quize button below.</p>

        <p>Select box with 1-10 as options</p>
        <p>Select box with 1-5 or All, as options</p>
        <p>Select box with true-false, multiple-choice, or both as options</p>

        <p>Start Quiz Button</p>

        <h3>Quiz Page</h3>
        <p>[content, images, data for the subpage]</p>

        <p>The content for this page will just be a list of 1-10 questions, each in their own cells and a submit quiz button at the buttom. After the quiz is submitted it will be graded and the users score will be shown. Under this will be a try again button that will take them back to the home page to make a new quiz</p>

        <p>Because of the need for many questions to avoid repeats if possible, I currently have around 70. I will list 10 here. The rest can be found in the questions.mjs file in the final_project folder.</p>
